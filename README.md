# SFMLSharp
This repo contains the code for SFMLSharp, a CSFML binding in C# with the style of the original SFML and with all of the .NET thingies.

## What is SFML?
Official Page: https://www.sfml-dev.org/

SFML is a simple, fast, cross-platform and object-oriented multimedia API. It provides access to windowing, graphics, audio and network. It is originally written in C++, and this is a binding over the C binding in C# for .NET 6.0.

An existing [.NET binding of SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML.Net) has already existed, but it use .NET Standard 2.0 that is already compatible with all of the .NET languages and runtimes. However, this project aims for speed over compatibility, matching original SFML style, using latest tools and feature, and to be keep updated with the lastest .NET version.
